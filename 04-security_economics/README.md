# Week 4: Security Economics

This week is focused on economics and its applications to security. We will be covering:

- The spam economy, and how its analysis led to an effective intervention
- The mechanisms of trust in cybercriminal markets
- How economic thinking applies to security incentives elsewhere

In the labs, you will be analysing factors that contributed to the longevity of
different darknet marketplaces.

## Reading

This week's reading is "A trading market to incentivise secure software" by Rao et al., available [here](reading_rao.pdf).
