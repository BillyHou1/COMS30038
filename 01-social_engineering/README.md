# Week 1: Social Engineering

This week focuses on social engineering, the exploitation of human vulnerabilities in attacks. We will be covering:

- famous con artists and social engineers
- key principles underpinning human persuasion
- how false pretexts can be constructed and deployed
- the methods by which information can be gathered to prepare an attack 

In the labs, you'll get the chance to analyse and design scam emails, and build a phishing site.

## Reading

This week's reading is Chapter 2 of "The Art of Deception", by Mitnick & Simon. You can access this excerpt [here](reading_mitnick_ch2.pdf).
