# Description
This week we explore **Inclusive Security** — extending usable security to account for diversity, accessibility, and fairness.  
If *usable security* is about fitting the task to the human, *inclusive security* asks: **which humans are we fitting to?**

We discuss how exclusion (whether physical, cognitive, cultural, or socio-economic) can lead to insecurity, and how inclusive design improves both usability and resilience.  
By the end, students should understand how inclusive security practices help create systems that are **fair, accessible, and adaptive to context**.

# Exercises
## “Different Threat Models” Reflection
Consider three different user contexts (e.g., an activist, an older adult, and a student).  
For each, outline:
- Their **primary security risks**.  
- How a standard security design (like automatic session lockout, or facial recognition) might **fail or endanger** them.  
- A design adaptation that would make it more inclusive and safe.

## Error in Practice 
Add two security events to the matrix making sure to not your rationale for its position relative to both Failure and Intentionality

“Exclusion is a latent failure in security design.”  
Do you agree?  
Use one real-world example to support your argument (e.g., biometric bias, inaccessible CAPTCHA, or domestic-abuse threat models).  

## Key Questions for Reflection
- Who is the “default user” in most security design assumptions?  
- What happens when users are left out of the protection model?  
- How can inclusivity improve both usability and trust in security?
