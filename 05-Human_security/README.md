# Week 5: Human in the Loop & Usable Security

This week focuses on human in the loop and usable security. We will be covering:

- What is meant by "human in the loop"
- The roles humans play and why it is important to consider humans when thinking about security

- Usable Security and its roots
- Security tasks and human factors that affect how users complete security task. 

In the labs, you'll get paired with a colleague and get a list of topics around security to discuss and debate in Week 7.

In this week's lab, you will work in small groups and a Teaching Assistant (TA), who will be there to help you with any questions!
 
During this session you will: 
- Get assigned a topic to research and debate in the next lab session and position (for/against) 
- Discuss how to debate and collaborate well
- Receive some tips on public speaking
- Be introduced to the format and topic of the event
- Will be assigned into teams
- Brainstorm how to approach the topic


You should meet with your TA group in the labs. You will need:

- [The lab worksheet]()
- [Topic list]()
