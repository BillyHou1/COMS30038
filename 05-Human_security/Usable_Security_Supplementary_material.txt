# Description
This week we firstly look at the need for security to be usable followed by a dive into the world of error, where and why this manifests and how we can harness error for good.

# Exercises
On slides as always but:
## Usable Security 
Pick ANY security tool (other than a password manager!) and, based on your own experience, see if you can answer the three usability measures for it:
Effectiveness "Can users achieve their goals?”
Efficiency "What resources are expended to do so?”
Satisfaction "What is the user level of comfort and acceptability?"

## Error in Practice 
Add two security events to the matrix making sure to not your rationale for its position relative to both Failure and Intentionality

Consider the login screen as to what might be wrong with it
