# Security Behaviours

Unit materials for the _Security Behaviours_ unit (COMS30088).


## Unit Overview

The security of complex socio-technical systems relies on the behaviour of human agents as much as it relies on the correctness of technical controls. Poor choices made in the design, development and deployment of security controls can provoke legitimate users into errors, creating or exacerbating vulnerabilities in a system.  Similarly, security controls cannot be effectively designed without an understanding of the adversary being defended against -- their capabilities, motivations and typical behaviours. This unit explores both sides of these 'human factors' underlying cybersecurity.  


## Unit Delivery

There are four major locations for the delivery of this unit:

1. **The weekly content on Github**. You can access this through the weekly folders indexed below. Each page will contain links to the video lectures, notes and other content, including lab worksheets.
2. **The Teams channel for this unit**. If you have questions about the unit or material, you can raise them in _Questions and Answers_. You will also have your own TA groups for tackling lab exercises, and each TA group has a private channel for freeform discussion and for getting feedback on exam practice. 
3. **Queens Building, 1.07**. This is where the weekly in-person lecture will be held, on Mondays at 10:00. As well as bringing your own questions about the material, be prepared to discuss the previous week's reading and get an overview of the coming topic.
4. **Queens Building, 1.80**. This is where the in-person labs will be held, on Wednesdays at 11:00. Meet with your TA group (and TA) and tackle the lab exercises. If you cannot attend the labs in person, you can collaborate via your TA group's channel on Teams.

For those of you on the MAJOR version of the course, the mid-term will take place in Week 8.
