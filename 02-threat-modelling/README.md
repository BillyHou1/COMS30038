# Week 2: Threat Modelling

This week focuses on threat modelling, and understanding how cyber-attacks are carried out. We will be covering:
- The cyber-killchain model of cyber-attacks
- Attack trees for understanding security risks
- The security operations cycle

In the labs, you will build some attack trees collaboratively, and search for suspicious patterns in log data.

## Reading 

This week's reading is "An Evening with Berferd" by Bill Cheswick. You can access a copy of this paper [here](reading_berferd.pdf).
