# Description
This week we firstly look at the the role that cognitive and physiological biases (as human constraints) can play in helping error occur.  This we follow with a look at Security Ergonomics by Design - a framework designed to help design out (or at least around) as much active and latent failure as possible to create safe & secure systems.

## Biases

# Exercises
## Bias
Please take this VERY short online test: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html

Then try to answer the following for the AMA session:
Are you aware of any cognitive biases you may have?  What are they?

How might they impact your ability to be secure (either personally or in your work)?

How might Usable Security help / hinder bias?

Can you think of any other cognitive biases from the codex which might have likely implications for cyber security, and how?  (bonus brownie points if it’s not one I’ve picked)


## Security Ergonomics 
None.  You've done enough here I think
